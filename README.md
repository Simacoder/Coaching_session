## Overview

In this coaching session, we explore the practical side of data science and analytics. We'll work through a complete machine learning pipeline using a real-world dataset (a simulated sales dataset for risky Loan default analysis). Weâ€™ll cover data generation, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, and deployment.

---

## Session Objectives

- **Understand the Value of Data Science:** Learn how data science and analytics drive decision-making in business.
- **Hands-On Data Preparation:** Generate and preprocess real-world sales data.
- **Build & Evaluate Models:** Train models to forecast sales using techniques such as Random Forest Regression.
- **Deploy Models:** Deploy your models using FastAPI and Docker.
- **Visualize Data & Predictions:** Create interactive dashboards using Streamlit.
- **Interactive Learning:** Participate in live coding and quizzes to reinforce key concepts.

---

## Prerequisites

Before attending the session, please ensure you have the following installed:

- **Python 3.8+**
- **Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab**
- **Docker** ([Installation Instructions](https://www.docker.com/get-started))
- **FastAPI** and **Uvicorn** (`pip install fastapi uvicorn`)
- **Streamlit** (`pip install streamlit`)
- Additional Python packages: `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `plotly`, `seaborn`, `pickle`, `mlflow`

## Project Example: Loan default analysis 

### Data Generation

A Python script is provided to generate a simulated sales dataset including:
- Transaction date
- Store location
- Product, category, and pricing details
- Customer demographics and payment method
- Seasonal discounts and trends

### Data Analysis & Transformation

Key steps include:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Pandas, Seaborn, and Plotly.
- Statistical analysis and correlation heatmaps.
- Data transformation techniques like one-hot encoding and normalization.

### Model Training & Evaluation

The session covers:
- Splitting the data into training and testing sets.
- Training a Random Forest model.
- Evaluating model performance using metrics like MAE (Mean Absolute Error).
- Strategies to prevent overfitting and data leakage.

### API Deployment with FastAPI & Docker

Learn to:
- Build a FastAPI endpoint to serve model predictions.
- Use Pydantic for request validation.
- Containerize the application with Docker for deployment.

### Live Dashboard with Streamlit

Create an interactive dashboard that:
- Visualizes sales trends and statistical insights.
- Provides real-time predictions via an integrated API.
- Offers user-friendly filters and dynamic charts.

---

## Live Coding & Quizzes

During the session, you'll participate in:
- **Live Coding:** Step-by-step coding exercises to implement data processing, modeling, and deployment.
- **Interactive Quizzes:** Quick questions to test your understanding of concepts such as overfitting, feature engineering, and API development.

---

## Next Steps & Additional Resources

After the session, you can further explore:
- **MLOps and CI/CD:** Automating model retraining and deployment.
- **Cloud Deployment:** Deploying your applications on AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure.
- **Advanced Analytics:** Time-series forecasting with LSTM, reinforcement learning, and more.
